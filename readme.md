# The Famous Literary Group 

The Famous Literary Group is a community of writers publishing under one name. It is an international branch out of the Czech literary group Slavná literární skupina that was founded in 2011.

The system features:
- famous articles,
- famous translations 
- famous books  
- the daily scrap. 

While the famous interface exists only for the official members, the daily scrap is an opened platform that allows anyone to participate simply by posting ‘scrap’ using their email address and password. 

The publishing system recognises basic types of posts (translations, articles) and their attributes (draft, private, public). 

The system uses Laravel framework, bootstrap, reCAPTCHA and others.
